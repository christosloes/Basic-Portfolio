				<p>Hello World!!! A little about me; I am currently pursuing a career change. For the better part of my academic and professional career I have designed and built art from concept to completion. Whether the client is a distillery in need of a new neon sign, a fortune 500 company's R&D department needing new machined prototypes, or a neighbor wanting some new planter boxes I have built and made many objects from scratch. I aquired the skills necessary to complete such projects through study, trial and error, and many hours of headscratching. I am attempting the same with web development. Through many hours of coding and googling I am slowly and steadily learning the skills to be able to build entire websites from scratch.
